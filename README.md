# countryDifferencesOnGigLabor

The rapidly growing platform economy has raised significant discussions around labor relations and labor rights that are different from traditional employment. Platform work, namely paid work mediated by online platforms, (Joyce et al. 2019), has posed various challenges to “standard employment relationship” regarding workplace regulation, labor protection, contractual relations of employment, etc. The huge debate mainly revolves around the question of to what extent platform work is beneficial or exploitative to ordinary workers; and further whether or not platform workers should be recognized as formal employees and enjoy basic labor protection, and ultimately, are gig workers “independent contractor” or “formal employees”? To date, a large amount of attention from the public, social media, academia, and the government, has focused on exploring different platforms, such as Uber, which offers us rich information to develop a project to better understand the geography of platform work “conundrum”. Against this background, our project aims to present broad geographical information on the platform economy and to visualize some of the key events that facilitate a general rethinking of labor relations in the platform economy. The target audience would be professionals involved in labor legislation, labor rights activists, governors in labor regulation, the public who care about platform economy, and scholars/researchers who want to have overview ideas on related topics. 

## Some of the key themes we are hoping to present in our final project:
### The population involved in platform work in different countries
  - Dataset: second-hand data collected by Joyce et al. (2019)
  - Multimedia: Mapbox interactive map
### Contextual data on different regulations on platform work
  - Dataset: social media 
    - U.K.’s Supreme Court upheld a ruling that Uber’s drivers should be classified as workers rather than independent contractors. 
    - New Zealand Uber drivers win landmark case declaring them employees.
    - Other social media story (TBD)
  - Multimedia: story map (not sure which one)
### Discourse on gig/platform economy in different countries
  - Dataset: Twitter
  - Multimedia: the world could

## Some of the functions we would love to provide:
- When readers click on a certain country, they can see the definition of platform workers (different countries tend to use different definitions) and the population of platform workers. 
- Pop-up window to show some of the milestones in labor relations in platform employment.
- Pop-up window to show different public discussions around gig economy in different regions to understand how people’s attitude towards the platform economy is affected by their geographical location.

## Exemplary project: 
One example that may be useful is Marikina City from the project instructions. This one is helpful because it presents both text information and map visualization. But we would love to talk more with the instructor and TA to find more useful examples.
